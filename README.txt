<summary><strong>Summary of Optimizations in Booking Repository:</strong></summary>
Reorganized the code: The code was rearranged to improve readability and maintainability. Proper indentation and formatting were applied.

Removed unnecessary conditions: Unused conditions and redundant checks were eliminated to simplify the code and improve performance.

Reduced database queries: Multiple database queries were consolidated and optimized by using eager loading and query optimization techniques. This helped to minimize the number of database calls and improve efficiency.

Simplified if conditions: Complex if conditions with multiple checks were simplified using logical operators and concise expressions, making the code more readable.

Replaced deprecated functions: Deprecated functions such as array_only and lists were replaced with their modern equivalents.

Refactored variable assignments: Redundant variable assignments were removed, and variable names were updated to improve clarity and readability.

Optimized database updates: Database update operations were optimized by using the update method instead of retrieving the model and then saving it.

Improved code reuse: Wherever possible, common code blocks were consolidated into reusable functions to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.

Added comments: Comments were added to explain the purpose and functionality of certain code sections.

Overall, these optimizations aimed to enhance the performance, readability, and maintainability of the code snippet, resulting in more efficient and optimized code.

<summary><strong>Summary of Optimization in BookingController:</strong></summary>
Constructor Injection: The BookingController now utilizes constructor injection to inject the BookingRepository dependency, improving code maintainability and testability.

Method Extraction: The index method has been refactored to reduce complexity. It now checks the user role and delegates the task to the appropriate method in the BookingRepository for retrieving bookings.

Request Validation: The store and update methods now perform request validation to ensure that only valid data is processed. This helps prevent unexpected errors and improves the security of the application.

Method Refactoring: Several methods such as show, immediateJobEmail, getHistory, acceptJob, acceptJobWithId, cancelJob, endJob, customerNotCall, getPotentialJobs, distanceFeed, reopen, resendNotifications, and resendSMSNotifications have been refactored for improved code readability and maintainability.

Code Cleanup: Unused imports and redundant code have been removed from the controller to improve code cleanliness and reduce clutter.

Error Handling: The resendSMSNotifications method now handles exceptions that may occur during SMS notification sending. It provides a proper response message in case of failure.

Code Formatting: The entire codebase has been formatted according to the PSR-12 coding standards to ensure consistent and readable code.

These optimizations enhance the overall efficiency, readability, and maintainability of the BookingController code.

<summary><strong>Summary of Optimization in BaseRepository:</strong></summary>
Removed redundant method validatorAttributeNames as it is not being used.

Added type hints and return types for methods to improve code clarity and enable better IDE support.

Replaced the throw statement inside the _validate method with a throw new statement to throw the ValidationException instance.

Improved the validate method to throw a ValidationException directly instead of returning a boolean value.

Simplified the find method to return null if the record is not found, instead of throwing a ModelNotFoundException.

Updated the findBySlug method to throw a ModelNotFoundException if the record is not found, eliminating the need for an additional check.

These optimizations enhance the code's readability, remove redundant code, and improve error handling in the BaseRepository class.

## BookingController

### Suggestions:
- **Implement Request Validation**: Add request validation to the `store` and `update` methods to ensure that only valid data is processed. You can use Laravel's validation features or create custom validation logic. `<tag>Validation</tag>`

- **Extract Business Logic**: Identify any complex business logic within the controller methods and consider extracting them into separate methods or services. This will help improve code readability and maintainability. `<tag>Code Organization</tag>`

- **Implement Response Formatting**: Standardize the format of the responses returned by the controller. Consider using a consistent JSON structure or creating response classes to handle different response scenarios. `<tag>Response Formatting</tag>`

- **Error Handling and Logging**: Enhance the error handling mechanism by implementing appropriate exception handling and logging. This will help you track and troubleshoot errors effectively. `<tag>Error Handling</tag>`

- **Implement Authentication and Authorization**: If not already done, add authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the controller's endpoints. This can be achieved using Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features. `<tag>Authentication</tag>`

## BookingRepository

### Suggestions:
- **Optimize Database Queries**: Analyze the database queries performed within the repository methods and optimize them as necessary. Consider using eager loading, query optimization techniques, and caching mechanisms to improve performance. `<tag>Database Optimization</tag>`

- **Extract Reusable Logic**: Identify any reusable logic within the repository methods and extract them into separate methods or traits. This will promote code reusability and maintainability. `<tag>Code Reusability</tag>`

- **Implement Caching**: If applicable, introduce caching mechanisms to cache frequently accessed data and reduce the load on the database. Utilize Laravel's caching features to implement caching effectively. `<tag>Caching</tag>`

- **Implement Transactions**: If the repository methods involve multiple database operations, consider wrapping them in transactions to ensure data consistency and atomicity. `<tag>Transactions</tag>`

- **Use Repository Design Pattern**: Evaluate whether implementing the Repository design pattern aligns with your application's architecture. The Repository pattern can help abstract the data access logic and make it more maintainable. `<tag>Design Pattern</tag>`

## Helper Function:

Consider creating a helper function or a helper class that encapsulates common operations related to bookings. This helper function can be used within both the BookingController and the BookingRepository to avoid code duplication and promote reusability.

For example, you can create a `BookingHelper` class with methods such as `calculateTotalPrice`, `validateBookingData`, or `sendBookingConfirmationEmail`. These methods can handle specific booking-related tasks and can be used whenever needed. `<tag>Helper Function</tag>`

## Model Trait:

You can create a trait, such as `TimestampsTrait`, to encapsulate common functionality related to timestamps in your models. This trait can define methods like `getFormattedCreatedAt`, `getFormattedUpdatedAt`, or `setTimestamps`. The trait can be easily included in any model that requires timestamp functionality, providing code reusability and maintainability. `<tag>Model Trait</tag>`

These suggestions aim to improve the structure, performance, maintainability, and reusability of your BookingController and BookingRepository. Adapt them according to your specific requirements and the architecture of your application.
